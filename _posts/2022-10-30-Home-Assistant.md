## Main page describing my Home Assistant setup

...So I have a good place to review what I didn't do right...

## The current configuration
* Dell Optiplex 7040 - total - $251
  - renewed - $150
    - Intel Quad Core i5-6500T - 3.1GHz 
    - 8GB DDR3 SRAM
    - 256 GB SSD (replaced with a larger HDD)
  - Leven JM300 M.2 SSD 480GB - Sata 3 - $28
  - WD Blue 1TB HDD - 5400 RPM Sata3 - $40
  - Coral.ai M.2 TPU Accelerator - $33
  - Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)
    - a lot of issue getting debian to boot after installation
    - needed to do 'expert install' 
    - saying 'yes' when GRUB install asks about 'buggy' uefi firmware
    - see   {% post_url 2022-10-32-debian-optiplex-7030 %}
