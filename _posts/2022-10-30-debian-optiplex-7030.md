## The engine turns but doesn't start

Following a variety of doc's found on the webs, it should 'just work'.

I could install a variety of other distributions (ex: alpine, ubuntu) and they would boot fine after install.  

Debian 11 would just not play well.

After a few days of trial and error, here was the [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/t28k97/comment/hyqsxu4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} that opened the door for me.

The question box regarding buggy implementation looks something like
