Welcome to the site of an greybeard who desires to keep learning.

The site's purpose is to record the discoveries and journeys that I am encountering in everything geeky (and occasionally non-geeky)

I'll try to keep the snark and the opinions to a minimum... but no promises :)

Thanks to Barry Clark's <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">Jekyll Now Template</a>, which I blantantly used (stole) as the basis for this site.
